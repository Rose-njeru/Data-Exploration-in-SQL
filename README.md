Exploration of data using the Covid-19 dataset
After downloading the dataset i created two tables, the death table and vaccinations table then uploaded them into MySQL workbench.
 Querries written were used  determine the totalcases vs population,the deathcount vs population,the continent and location with the highest 
death count, 
total vaccinations vs population by joining the deaths table and the vaccinations tables,used window functions ans CTE's to determine the rolling_people vaccinated.
Lastly created a view for later vizualization using Tableau.
